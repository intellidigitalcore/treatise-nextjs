        "descOne":"Here at Clubhouse we believe in the transformative power of friendship. Why? The answer is pretty simple: friendship brings people together. It transcends culture and race, sex and religion. It can be as simple as finding someone who shares the same niche interests as yourself like pickleball (ok, maybe not as niche as it used to be), or as challenging as finding someone you trust to share your life with, like a new business partner or a significant other. Friendship means people can support each other near and far. When friends come together, it is powerful; they can change the world. And this is exactly why we chose Iranian/African American comedian and social activist Tehran Von Ghasri, founder of the “I Am Tehran” club, Mary Amini, and Parisa Rose as our new icons. The three of them met on Clubhouse and have become closer as a result of their shared passion for change.  ",

        "descOne":"Here at Clubhouse we believe in the transformative power of friendship. Why? The answer is pretty simple: friendship brings people together. It transcends culture and race, sex and religion. It can be as simple as finding someone who shares the same niche interests as yourself like pickleball (ok, maybe not as niche as it used to be), or as challenging as finding someone you trust to share your life with, like a new business partner or a significant other. Friendship means people can support each other near and far. When friends come together, it is powerful; they can change the world. And this is exactly why we chose Iranian/African American comedian and social activist Tehran Von Ghasri, founder of the “I Am Tehran” club, Mary Amini, and Parisa Rose as our new icons. The three of them met on Clubhouse and have become closer as a result of their shared passion for change.  ",
